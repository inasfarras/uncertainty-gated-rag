# System Comparison (5 Questions)

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Purpose**: Validate that Anchor (Gate OFF) and Baseline systems work correctly

---

## Systems Tested

### 1. Anchor with Gate OFF (No BAUG)
- **Config**: Anchor pipeline + Rerank + Hybrid search
- **BAUG**: ❌ Disabled (gate-off)
- **Features**: Multi-anchor retrieval, type validators, finalizer
- **Rounds**: Up to MAX_ROUNDS (3) without gate control

### 2. Baseline (Simple RAG)
- **Config**: Single-pass vector search
- **Features**: ❌ No rerank, no hybrid, no anchors, no validators
- **Rounds**: 1 (one-shot retrieval + generation)
- **Pure**: Minimal RAG (question → embed → search → generate)

## Key Observations

### 1. ✅ Both Systems Working Correctly

**Anchor (Gate OFF):**
```
Running evaluation for system: 'anchor' with gate OFF
```
- ✅ Runs multi-round retrieval (up to 3 rounds)
- ✅ Uses anchors, rerank, hybrid search, type validators
- ✅ NO BAUG decisions (gate disabled)
- ✅ Higher answer rate (60% answered vs 20% baseline)

**Baseline:**
```
Running evaluation for system: 'baseline' with gate N/A
```
- ✅ Simple one-shot retrieval
- ✅ No enhancements (pure vector search)
- ✅ Fast but low recall (80% abstention)
- ✅ Minimal token usage

### 2. 📊 Performance Gaps

**Why Anchor (Gate OFF) is Better:**
1. **Multi-round retrieval** → 3 chances to find evidence
2. **Anchor-based exploration** → Better entity/keyword focus
3. **Reranking** → Precision improvement
4. **Hybrid search** → BM25 + Vector = better coverage
5. **Type validators** → Checks for required info (years, categories, etc.)

**Why Baseline Abstains More:**
- Single-pass vector search misses context
- No second chances to refine query
- Lower retrieval quality → LLM says "I don't know"

### 3. 🎯 Correct Answers

**Anchor (Gate OFF):**
- ✅ **Salesforce** (Perfect match, EM=1.0)
  - Used multi-anchor retrieval + rerank
  - Found correct context on first round

**Baseline:**
- ❌ **3M (wrong)** instead of Salesforce
  - Single-pass vector search retrieved wrong context
  - Hallucinated from irrelevant document

## Per-Question Breakdown

### Q1: "How many 3-point attempts did Steve Nash average?"
| System | Answer | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anchor (Gate OFF)** | 5.0 per game | ❌ Hallucination (gold: 4) |
| **Baseline** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |

**Analysis**: Anchor found context but hallucinated specific numbers. Baseline couldn't find relevant context at all.

---

### Q2: "What is a movie to feature a person who can create and control a device that can manipulate the laws of physics?"
| System | Answer | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anchor (Gate OFF)** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |
| **Baseline** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |

**Analysis**: Both correctly abstained (difficult question, likely missing context in corpus).

---

### Q3: "Where did the CEO of Salesforce previously work?"
| System | Answer | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anchor (Gate OFF)** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |
| **Baseline** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |

**Analysis**: Both correctly abstained (gold: Oracle).

---

### Q4: "Which movie won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects in 2021?"
| System | Answer | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anchor (Gate OFF)** | Dune | ❌ Hallucination (gold: Tenet) |
| **Baseline** | I don't know | ⚠️ Safe IDK |

**Analysis**: Anchor found wrong context (2021 ceremony vs 2021 award year confusion). Baseline abstained.

---

### Q5: "What company in the Dow Jones is the best performer today?"
| System | Answer | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Anchor (Gate OFF)** | Salesforce (3.5% rally) | ✅ **Perfect** (EM=1.0) |
| **Baseline** | 3M (1.38% gain) | ❌ Hallucination |

**Analysis**:
- **Anchor**: Multi-anchor retrieval + rerank found correct context → perfect answer
- **Baseline**: Single-pass vector search retrieved wrong document → wrong answer

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run full evaluations (100 questions each):
   - Anchor with BAUG ON
   - Anchor with Gate OFF
   - Baseline

2. ✅ Compare:
   - BAUG impact (ON vs OFF)
   - Enhancement value (Anchor vs Baseline)
   - Cost/performance trade-offs

3. ✅ Document results in thesis
