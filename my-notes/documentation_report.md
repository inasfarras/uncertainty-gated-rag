# Master Thesis Project Documentation Report

## Project Overview
**Title**: Uncertainty-Gated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Repository**: https://github.com/inasfarras/uncertainty-gated-rag
**Last Updated**: September 17, 2025
**Current Branch**: `optimize-uncertainty-gate`

## Recent Major Updates

### 1. Enhanced Uncertainty Gate Implementation (September 17, 2025)

#### **Issue Identified**
The original uncertainty gate had several limitations affecting both accuracy and performance:
- **Accuracy Issues**:
  - Lexical uncertainty assessment was too simplistic (just keyword counting)
  - Response completeness evaluation was basic (length + punctuation only)
  - No semantic coherence analysis
  - Static weights that didn't adapt to question complexity
  - Limited novelty assessment

- **Performance Issues**:
  - Redundant computations on every gate consultation
  - No caching mechanism for repeated similar decisions
  - Heavy string operations without optimization
  - Sequential processing without batch capabilities

#### **Solution Implemented**
Developed a comprehensive enhancement to the uncertainty gate system with the following improvements:

##### **A. Accuracy Improvements**

1. **Semantic Coherence Analysis**
   - New `_assess_semantic_coherence()` function
   - Detects contradictory statements in responses
   - Analyzes logical flow indicators
   - Provides coherence scoring from 0.0 to 1.0

2. **Enhanced Lexical Uncertainty Assessment**
   - Weighted uncertainty/confidence indicators
   - Pre-compiled regex patterns for efficiency
   - Context-aware scoring based on response length
   - Caching mechanism for repeated assessments

3. **Advanced Completeness Evaluation**
   - Sentence structure analysis
   - Punctuation completeness scoring
   - Detection of incomplete thought patterns
   - Multi-factor scoring system

4. **Question Complexity Analysis**
   - New `_assess_question_complexity()` function
   - Adapts gate behavior based on question type
   - Length-based and keyword-based complexity scoring
   - Influences adaptive weight calculations

5. **Adaptive Weight System**
   - Dynamic weight adjustment based on question complexity
   - Round-based weight modifications
   - Context-aware penalty/bonus system
   - Normalized weight distribution

##### **B. Performance Optimizations**

1. **Intelligent Caching System**
   - LRU cache for gate decisions (`LRUCache` class)
   - Function-level caching for lexical assessments
   - Cache hit rate monitoring and statistics
   - Configurable cache size and behavior

2. **Batch Processing Capabilities**
   - `BatchProcessor` class for multiple response analysis
   - Pre-compiled regex patterns shared across batch
   - Reduced computational overhead for bulk operations

3. **Performance Profiling**
   - `PerformanceProfiler` class with timing decorators
   - Function-level performance monitoring
   - Statistical analysis of execution times
   - Bottleneck identification capabilities

4. **Early Stopping Optimizations**
   - Fast budget checks for immediate stopping
   - High-confidence fast paths
   - Optimized decision tree structure
