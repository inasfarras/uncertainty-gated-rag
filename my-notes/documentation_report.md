# Master Thesis Project Documentation Report

## Project Overview
**Title**: Uncertainty-Gated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**Repository**: https://github.com/inasfarras/uncertainty-gated-rag
**Last Updated**: September 17, 2025
**Current Branch**: `optimize-uncertainty-gate`

## Recent Major Updates

### 1. Enhanced Uncertainty Gate Implementation (September 17, 2025)

#### **Issue Identified**
The original uncertainty gate had several limitations affecting both accuracy and performance:
- **Accuracy Issues**:
  - Lexical uncertainty assessment was too simplistic (just keyword counting)
  - Response completeness evaluation was basic (length + punctuation only)
  - No semantic coherence analysis
  - Static weights that didn't adapt to question complexity
  - Limited novelty assessment

- **Performance Issues**:
  - Redundant computations on every gate consultation
  - No caching mechanism for repeated similar decisions
  - Heavy string operations without optimization
  - Sequential processing without batch capabilities

#### **Solution Implemented**
Developed a comprehensive enhancement to the uncertainty gate system with the following improvements:

##### **A. Accuracy Improvements**

1. **Semantic Coherence Analysis**
   - New `_assess_semantic_coherence()` function

2. **Enhanced Lexical Uncertainty Assessment**
   - Weighted uncertainty/confidence indicators
   - Pre-compiled regex patterns for efficiency
   - Context-aware scoring based on response length
   - Caching mechanism for repeated assessments

### 3. Code Quality Improvements Based on External Analysis (September 17, 2025)

#### **Issues Identified by Code Analysis**
External code review identified several important issues:

1. **Budget Handling Constants Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: Gate used hardcoded 200 tokens while config defined LOW_BUDGET_TOKENS = 500
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent budget thresholds across system

2. **Caching Not Actually Implemented**
   - **Issue**: ENABLE_GATE_CACHING flag existed but caching wasn't wired into decision logic
   - **Impact**: Misleading configuration and no performance benefits

3. **Missing Distinction Between Stop Types**
   - **Issue**: No differentiation between budget stops vs high-confidence stops
   - **Impact**: Poor observability and debugging capability

4. **Documentation Gaps**
   - **Issue**: No runbook for reproducing evaluations
   - **Impact**: Reduced reproducibility and onboarding friction

#### **Solutions Implemented**

##### **A. Budget Handling Standardization**
```python
# Before: Hardcoded constants
if signals.budget_left_tokens < 200:  # Hardcoded!

# After: Configuration-driven
if signals.budget_left_tokens < self.low_budget_tokens:  # Uses settings.LOW_BUDGET_TOKENS
```

- **Centralized Configuration**: All thresholds now pulled from Settings
- **Consistent Behavior**: Budget calculations use configured MAX_TOKENS_TOTAL
- **Future-Proof**: Tuning happens in single location (config.py)

##### **B. Proper Caching Implementation**
```python
def decide(self, signals: GateSignals) -> str:
    if self._enable_caching:
        cache_key = self._create_cache_key(signals)
        cached_result = self._get_from_cache(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            return cached_result["decision"]

        decision = self._decide_uncached(signals)
        self._store_in_cache(cache_key, decision, signals.extras or {})
        return decision
```

- **Functional Caching**: Cache actually stores and reuses decisions
- **LRU Eviction**: Prevents unbounded memory growth (max 100 entries)
- **Cache Metrics**: Real hit/miss tracking with performance statistics

##### **C. Enhanced Action Types**
```python
class GateAction:
    STOP = "STOP"
    RETRIEVE_MORE = "RETRIEVE_MORE"
    REFLECT = "REFLECT"
    ABSTAIN = "ABSTAIN"
    STOP_LOW_BUDGET = "STOP_LOW_BUDGET"  # New: Explicit budget stop
```

- **Distinguishable Stops**: Budget exhaustion vs high confidence clearly separated
- **Better Logging**: Downstream consumers can differentiate stop reasons
- **Enhanced Observability**: Metrics can track different stop types

##### **D. Comprehensive Runbook**
Created `docs/runbook.md` with:
- **Quick Start Guide**: 3-command evaluation setup
- **Detailed Options**: All parameters and configurations explained
- **Reproducible Experiments**: Deterministic evaluation procedures
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Performance Analysis**: Metrics interpretation and tuning

#### **Technical Implementation Details**

**Cache Key Generation**:
```python
def _create_cache_key(self, signals: GateSignals) -> str:
    key_components = [
        f"f:{signals.faith:.2f}",      # Rounded for cache efficiency
        f"o:{signals.overlap:.2f}",
        f"budget:{signals.budget_left_tokens // 100}00",  # Bucketed
    ]
    return "|".join(key_components)
```

**Configuration Integration**:
```python
self.low_budget_tokens = settings.LOW_BUDGET_TOKENS    # 500 tokens
self.max_tokens_total = settings.MAX_TOKENS_TOTAL      # 3500 tokens
```

**Enhanced Testing**:
