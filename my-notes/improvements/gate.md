# Uncertainty Gate Improvement Plan
**Date**: September 18, 2025

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the Uncertainty Gate.

---

The uncertainty gate is already quite mature, and recent analysis showed it is functioning correctly. The highest-priority improvements are in the agentic retrieval pipeline, not the gate itself.

However, the following enhancements to the gate can be considered after the retrieval process has been improved:

1.  **Tighter Integration with the "Judge"**: The signals from the "Judge" module (which assesses context quality) should be fed directly into the gate. A "low context quality" signal from the Judge could be a powerful input for the gate's decision-making process.
2.  **Consider ML-Based Assessment**: For a future iteration, the heuristic-based scoring system could be replaced or augmented with a small, fine-tuned classifier model. This model could be trained to predict the probability of a response being correct based on the various signals, potentially capturing more complex patterns than the current rule-based system.
3.  **Monitor Cache Hit Rates in Production**: Once the agent is deployed or used in more extensive evaluations, the cache hit rates should be monitored. If the hit rate is low, the cache key generation logic in `_create_cache_key` may need to be adjusted (e.g., by using wider buckets for signal values) to improve efficiency.
