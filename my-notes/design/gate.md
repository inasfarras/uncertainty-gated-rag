# Uncertainty Gate Notes
**Date**: September 18, 2025

## Current Implementation

The uncertainty gate is a critical component that acts as a quality control mechanism for the agent's responses. It decides whether the agent should continue working on a problem (`RETRIEVE_MORE`), stop and provide an answer (`STOP`), or abstain because the answer is unknowable from the available context (`ABSTAIN`).

The current implementation in `src/agentic_rag/agent/gate.py` is highly sophisticated and was significantly enhanced on September 17, 2025.

### Key Features:

#### A. Accuracy Improvements
1.  **Semantic Coherence Analysis**: Detects contradictions and analyzes the logical flow within a generated response.
2.  **Enhanced Lexical Uncertainty**: Uses weighted indicators and regex to find phrases that signal low confidence (e.g., "might be," "possibly").
3.  **Advanced Completeness Evaluation**: Goes beyond simple length checks to analyze sentence structure and punctuation for signs of incomplete thoughts.
4.  **Question Complexity Analysis**: Assesses the user's question to understand if it's simple or complex, which informs other gate heuristics.
5.  **Adaptive Weight System**: Dynamically adjusts the importance of different signals based on the question's complexity and the current round of interaction.

#### B. Performance Optimizations
1.  **Intelligent Caching**: Uses an LRU cache (`LRUCache`) to store and quickly retrieve decisions for similar signal states, dramatically speeding up repeated assessments.
2.  **Batch Processing**: Provides a `BatchProcessor` for analyzing multiple responses at once, reducing overhead.
3.  **Performance Profiling**: Includes a `PerformanceProfiler` with timing decorators to identify bottlenecks.
4.  **Early Stopping**: Uses fast budget checks and high-confidence fast paths to avoid unnecessary computation.
