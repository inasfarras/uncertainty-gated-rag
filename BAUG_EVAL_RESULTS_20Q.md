## üìä BAUG Decision Distribution

**Out of 31 total BAUG decisions across 20 questions:**

| Action | Count | % | Description |
|--------|-------|---|-------------|
| **RETRIEVE_MORE** | 11 | 35% | Continue search (low overlap/coverage) |
| **REFLECT** | 11 | 35% | üÜï **Borderline metrics detected** |
| **STOP** | 9 | 29% | Sufficient evidence (overlap + coverage OK) |
| **ABSTAIN** | 0 | 0% | No premature abstentions |
| **STOP_LOW_GAIN** | 0 | 0% | ‚úÖ **Eliminated** (was ambiguous) |

---

## üîç REFLECT Analysis

### Trigger Conditions (All 11 Cases)
```
Reason: borderline_metrics, faith_gray_zone:0.60
  - Faithfulness = 0.60 (just below threshold 0.65)
  - Gray zone: TAU_LO (0.35) ‚â§ faith < FAITHFULNESS_TAU (0.65)
  - Coverage = 0.50-1.00 (adequate to attempt reflection)
```

### Sample REFLECT Decisions

**Example 1: QID 161a89f3**
```json
{
  "round": 2,
  "action": "REFLECT",
  "reasons": ["borderline_metrics", "faith_gray_zone:0.60"],
  "signals": {
    "overlap_est": 0.00,
    "faith_est": 0.60,
    "anchor_coverage": 1.00,
    "budget_left": 1754
  }
}
```

**Example 2: QID 3569f7c6**
```json
{
  "round": 2,
  "action": "REFLECT",
  "reasons": ["borderline_metrics", "faith_gray_zone:0.60"],
  "signals": {
    "overlap_est": 0.00,
    "faith_est": 0.60,
    "anchor_coverage": 0.50,
    "budget_left": 1680
  }
}
```

**Impact**: System now **adaptively refines answers** when metrics are borderline, rather than blindly retrieving more or stopping prematurely.

---

## ‚úÖ STOP Decisions (Clean)

All 9 STOP decisions were clean with proper justification:

```
Reason: overlap_ok, coverage_ok
  - overlap ‚â• 0.20 (threshold)
  - coverage ‚â• 0.30 (minimum required)
  - Examples: overlap=1.00, faith=1.00, coverage=1.00
```

**Sample questions that stopped cleanly:**
- QID 06511362: "What is the average gross for the top 3 Pixar movies?"
- QID 2d4079bd: "What is the ex-dividend date of Microsoft in Q1 2024?"
- QID 30395ec2: "Which movie won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects in 2021?"

## üö´ STOP_LOW_GAIN Eliminated

**Before improvements:**
```python
return "STOP_LOW_GAIN", ["low_new_hits"]  # Ambiguous!
```

**After improvements:**
```python
if sig.overlap_est > 0 or sig.faith_est > tau_lo:
    return GateAction.STOP, ["low_new_hits", "low_gain_weak_evidence"]
else:
    return GateAction.ABSTAIN, ["low_new_hits", "no_new_evidence"]
```

**Result**: 0 instances of `STOP_LOW_GAIN` in logs ‚úÖ

## üî¨ Enhanced Logging Structure

**New `baug_decision` object in every round log:**

```json
{
  "qid": "...",
  "round": 2,
  "action": "REFLECT",
  "baug_reasons": ["borderline_metrics", "faith_gray_zone:0.60"],
  "baug_decision": {
    "action": "REFLECT",
    "reasons": ["borderline_metrics", "faith_gray_zone:0.60"],
    "signals": {
      "overlap_est": 0.00,
      "faith_est": 0.60,
      "anchor_coverage": 1.00,
      "new_hits_ratio": 0.05,
      "conflict_risk": 0.05,
      "budget_left": 1754,
      "has_reflect_left": true
    },
    "thresholds": {
      "overlap_tau": 0.20,
      "faithfulness_tau": 0.65,
      "coverage_min": 0.30,
      "new_hits_eps": 0.05
    },
    "round_idx": 1,
    "gate_kind": "built-in"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ All signals in one place
- ‚úÖ Thresholds logged for reproducibility
- ‚úÖ Easy post-hoc analysis
- ‚úÖ Can track signal trends across rounds

## üéì Key Insights

### 1. REFLECT Adoption Rate
- **35% of decisions** triggered REFLECT
- All due to borderline faithfulness (0.60 just below 0.65)
- Shows system is **adaptive** to gray-zone scenarios

### 2. No Premature Abstentions
- 0 ABSTAIN decisions from BAUG
- All 10 "I don't know" answers were LLM-driven
- **Correct behavior**: System tries hard before giving up

### 3. Clean Action Space
- Only 4 actions: STOP, RETRIEVE_MORE, REFLECT, ABSTAIN
- No ambiguous STOP_LOW_GAIN
- Clear decision rationale in every case

### 4. Hallucinations Still Present
- 6 hallucinated answers detected by judge
- Separate from BAUG improvements (retrieval/generation issue)
- Next priority: improve retrieval precision
