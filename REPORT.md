# Agentic RAG Project - Progress Report

This report summarizes the work completed to fix and refactor the Agentic RAG baseline.

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] **Settings Refactor:** Switched to `pydantic-settings` and defined a clear, typed configuration in `src/agentic_rag/config.py`.
- [x] **OpenAI-Only Pipeline:** Removed all dependencies on local `SentenceTransformer` and `torch`. The entire embedding and chat pipeline now uses the `openai` library.
- [x] **Simplified spaCy:** Made `spaCy` an optional dependency for the `is_global_question` check, with a fallback to a simple length-based heuristic.
- [x] **Corrected FAISS Implementation:** Ensured that vectors are normalized before being indexed and that `IndexFlatIP` is used for cosine similarity.
- [x] **Robust Ingestion CLI:** Implemented a `typer`-based CLI for the ingestion pipeline.
- [x] **Updated Tests:** The test suite now passes, with OpenAI API calls mocked to ensure deterministic behavior.
- [x] **Relaxed Linting/Mypy:** Added `ruff.toml` and `mypy.ini` with lenient configurations to speed up development.
- [x] **Updated `README.md`:** The documentation now includes a Windows-specific quickstart guide with updated commands.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

- **`black` not installed:** The `black` code formatter is not installed in the environment.
- **`ruff` issues:** `ruff` still reports 128 linting issues.
- **`mypy` errors:** `mypy` reports 22 type-checking errors.

## üõ† Next 5 Actions

1.  **Install `black`:**
    ```bash
    pip install black
    ```
2.  **Run `black`:**
    ```bash
    python -m black .
    ```
3.  **Address `ruff` issues:**
    Review the remaining `ruff` issues and fix them.
4.  **Address `mypy` errors:**
    Review the `mypy` errors and add type hints or fix type inconsistencies.
5.  **Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`:**
    Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file to run the ingestion and retrieval pipeline.
